Some of my early works, when I first started to learn programming.

<b>The files located here, are part of various study projects, at a beginner's level</b> -

<b>First Website: "Event SPACE Station"</b> - This project was built while I was still studying basic JavaScript. You can view the website <a href="https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects/First%20website/index.html">here</a>. <b>UPDATE:</b> I've moved on to the next project, and cetain functions in this website were disabled on purpose and won't work.

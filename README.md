Some of my early works, when I first started to learn programming.

<b>The files located here, are part of various study projects, at a beginner's level</b> -

<b>Second Website: "Typology Exercise"</b> - This is a study project I wanted to do after studying basic JavaScript. The goal was to create a platform for archaeology students to exercise identification of artifacts - thus improving their skills also when the actual material isn't available (like at home). If you're an archaeology professional who'd like to use this platform, don't hesitate to contact me :) . I wanted to practice vanilla JavaScript before moving on to studying JQuery and so on. No actual artifacts are displayed due to copyright restrictions. All other elements and images used are free for any use. All the current information displayed is only a sample and should not be regarded as accurate at all. You can view the actual website <a href="https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects/Second%20website/index.html">here</a>. The project was put on hold for the time being due to my personal scheudle.

<b>First Website: "Event SPACE Station"</b> - This project was built while I was still studying basic JavaScript. You can view the website <a href="https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects/First%20website/index.html">here</a>. <b>UPDATE:</b> I've moved on to the next project, and cetain functions in this website were disabled on purpose and won't work.

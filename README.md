The files were created as part of a study project, but were later modified and used for actual work in-front of customers.

The aim of the Text Copier file is to simply copy to the clipboard a pre-written text, so it can be pasted quickly as a reply to customers, instead of writing everything over and over again (or copying and pasting the usual way) - thus saving precious time.
The aim of the weight calculator is to provide the weight of products, in order to be able to tell quickly based on shipments\orders data - if the order shipped with everything in it, or not. Thus also saving time.

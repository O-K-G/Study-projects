# Welcome to my study projects!

Here you can inspect the code or watch the website I've built - https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects .
So far I went through HTML, CSS and these days I'm studying JavaScript (September 2019).

All of the projects are study and practice projects only.

Credits for certain parts of the code (for the top menu): https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav.asp - especially because I'm still learning JavaScript.

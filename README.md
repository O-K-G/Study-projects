Some of my early works, when I first started to learn programming.

<b>The files located here, are part of various study projects, at a beginner's level</b> -

<b>First Website</b> - Pre-Bootstrap website while still studying basic JavaScript. Topic chosen per request. You can view the website <a href="https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects/First%20website/index.html">here</a>.

<b>Text Copier</b> - A tiny tool I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to save time when replying e-mails etc', when repetitive messages are needed (greetings and such). It saves time by copying the text on a click of a button, instead of marking it, copying it and so on. it was later modified at work for CX operations -> using relevant text. You can view it <a href="https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects/Text-Copier.html">here</a>

<b>Weight Calculator</b> - Another tiny tool I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to easily calculate various orders weights (important for logistics), and save time when doing it. This was also later modified at work for CX operations -> using actual products ad weights. You can view it <a href="https://o-k-g.github.io/Study-projects/Weight-Calculator.html">here</a>
